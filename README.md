# GuitarProcessor-RasPi-PD-OSC

### I am creating simple guitar processor with pure data to be exact I am using purr data that can be downloaded from this github [repository](https://github.com/agraef/purr-data/releases).
### As for hardware it is going to run on Raspberry Pi eventually, but it can be run on virtualy any computer since pure data can run on almost every posible OS :) 
### I also want to controle processor with Android phone. For that I plan to use Open Sound Control(OSC) and probably TouchOSC but i will try few other Android apps just to see if I like some other one. For now TouchOSC seams really good.
